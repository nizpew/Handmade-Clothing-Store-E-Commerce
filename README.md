## Client request
    
We are seeking an experienced e-commerce developer to create a comprehensive online store for our handmade clothing brand. The primary goal is to establish a robust and user-friendly platform capable of serving customers in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The project requires full e-commerce functionality, including product listings, a secure shopping cart, and a streamlined checkout process. Integration with reliable payment gateways is essential.

We aim for a launch within three months, so efficiency and timely delivery are crucial.
